<h2> 📌 Overview </h2> <br><br>



<h2> 📌 My Process </h2<br>
I started by researching the structure and design of the original Discord website. <br>
I focused on creating a responsive and visually appealing clone using modern web development techniques. <br>
This project allowed me to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and gain confidence in building complex layouts.<br>

<h2> 📌 What I Learned </h2><br> 
👉 Web design principles.<br>
👉 How to optimize the website for production.<br>
👉 How to design a website from scratch.<br>
👉 Responsive Design (still Kevin Powell's Responsive Web Design course is the best)<br>
