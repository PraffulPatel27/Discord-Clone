📌 Overview



📌 My Process
I started by researching the structure and design of the original Discord website. 
I focused on creating a responsive and visually appealing clone using modern web development techniques. 
This project allowed me to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and gain confidence in building complex layouts.

📌 What I Learned
👉 Web design principles.
👉 How to optimize the website for production.
👉 How to design a website from scratch.
👉 Responsive Design (still Kevin Powell's Responsive Web Design course is the best)
