<h2> 📌 My Process </h2
<p> I started by researching the structure and design of the original Discord website. </p> 
<p> I focused on creating a responsive and visually appealing clone using modern web development techniques. </p> 
<p> This project allowed me to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and gain confidence in building complex layouts. </p>

<h2> 📌 What I Learned </h2>
<p> 👉 Web design principles. </p>
<p> 👉 How to optimize the website for production. </p>
<p> 👉 How to design a website from scratch. </p>
<p> 👉 Responsive Design (still Kevin Powell's Responsive Web Design course is the best. </p>
